			"KJ college fest had 3-4 anchoring auditions, on my 1st day of audition I was very nervous seeing so many students from all 4 KJ institute who came for audition, they were so strong and great in speaking ! The movement I had to stand on stage and speak for audition I was numb, I couldn't speak a single word ! I said sorry and was walking out of the room suddenly the judge stopped me and said \"Its ok, this happens for new comers\" He motivated me to speak up and yes I was selected in audition and meanwhile won Gold Medal in anchoring, it was great opportunity for me to stand alone in front of such a huge crowd and to make audience enjoy my anchoring with applause was challenging experience !!! After few days of winning this Gold medal I was travelling with my mother in crowded local bus, I was away from my mom and my face was covered with stole still two unknown girls from KJ college who were able to recognize me as KJ fest anchor and my mother was sitting next to them, they appreciated my anchoring, and they were repeating my dialogue line by line :) My mom was so happy that day, this was my first recognition for anchoring, later this kept on happening with me, many people appreciated my work. This was possible only because of that 2nd opportunity for anchoring audition, I can't put in words my thankfulness to this college who gave me opportunities, platform and name. Thanks a million !",
